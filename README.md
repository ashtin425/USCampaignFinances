# USCampaignFinances
For this project I used Excel for cleaning the data, Microsoft SQL Server to join tables together and display the desired columns, and Tableau to create the graphs and charts I want to use to display my findings. I also used figma to create the dashboard and implemented the tableau graphs and charts to create a overview of campaign finances from 1990 to 2016
